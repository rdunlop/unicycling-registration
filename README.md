Welcome to the Unicycling Registration Application.
==================================================

This application is designed to be used to receive and process online
registration for unicycling competitions/conventions.

I hope that it can be used for unicycling conventions around the world.

Its features include:
* Automatic increases of expenses based on registration periods (Early
  Registration, Late Registration)
* Customizable configuration of offered events, allowing detailed information
  gathering of the events that competitors will be competing in.
* Customizable configuration of expense items that can be offered for sale along
  with registration fees
* Integration with PayPal in order to receive payment of registration fee, and
  other expenses
* Administrative data reports which show the event sign-up details (how many
  people have signed up for each event)
* Administrative data reports which show the payment receipt details
* Administrative data-download options, which provide easy export of event sign
  up details.
* Judging and scoring systems for various competition types
* Multi-Language support, to allow the registration system to be enabled in any language


This documentation is broken into 2 sections:
* How to use the site for your own convention
* How to contribute time/effort to improving the application


How to use the site for your own convention
===========================================

The application is capable of running multiple conventions on a single server,
and no longer needs each convention to manage its own servers/hosting.

Contact Robin (robin@dunlopweb.com) in order to create a new convention. Generally you
will also want to use a 'test' instance in order to test/explore features without affecting your "live" site.


How to add/improve Translations
-------------------------------
If you would like to contribute language translations, the first step is to ask for a "translator" account.

Once you have a translator account, a "Translation" menu item will appear, which will allow you to see/adjust/improve the translations for any language (except English).

- If you find that there is any text which only appears in English, or where the english is incorrect, please use the "Feedback" form to let me know, and I'll enable it in the translation system.


If we want to add a new language to the list of possible translations:

1. First create a root-level `base.en.yml` file, and set the "language_name"

2. Add the language to the `all_available_languages` in the EventConfiguration class

3. Choose the language in your Event Configuration.

* app/views/layouts/application.rb - Ensure that the 'lang' attribute is appropriately set.

* app/views/layouts/_footer.html.haml - Ensure that the link to the language is appropriately tagged/translated.


Technical Details
-----------------
Each time that a deployment occurs, the translation files in /config/locales will be loaded into the database.

Since the English translatios are considered the "base locale", changes to those entris have specific impacts.

* If an English phrase is _added_, the db will have a new entry added, and marked so that non-English translations can be provided.

* If an English phrase is _updated_, the db will be marked so that the non-encglish phrases can be reviewed to ensure that they still make sense.

* If an English phraes is _deleted_, the db ...I don't know, I haven't done this yet.


Deploying code with new translations needed
--------------------------------------------

When you perform a `cap stage deploy` it will automatically run `rake import_translations_from_yml` and `rake write_tolk_to_disk` which will update the existing Tolk translations with any new/changed keys. No further steps should be necessary.

You may need to clear the translation cache in order for the existing cached pages to be cleared.

Downloading new translations from Tolk
--------------------------------------
Extracting the new translations out of the system, and back into the source-code

1. Use the "Apply" button in the translation system to write all Tolk Translations to disk (and apply them to the front-end)

2. Use the "Clear Translations Cache" button to cause all cached pages to be cleared, and new ones generated.

3. Copy the changed yml files down to your local machine:

    `cap stage translation:download`
    or
    `cap prod translation:download`

    this will copy the remote `config/locales` onto your local machine's `config/locales`

4. Examine the changes, to ensure that you aren't accidentally removing changes which you want.

5. Commit the changes.


Other Commands available (useful for testing:
---------------------------------------------

* Clear the current loaded Tolk Content (** This is a very destructive step. Be warned! **)

    `rake clear_translations`

    This command can also be useful if you want to remove invalid translations from the tolk db, and reload from disk.

* Load all translations from config/locales:

    `rake import_translations_from_yml`

* Restart the server


How to contribute time/effort to the Registration Site
======================================================

The following directions assume that you can use "google", and are willing to
read the instructions for github.

* Download the code from github
* Configure the Base Settings for the application (see below)
* Configure the Event Configuration (offered events/prices) (see below)


Base Settings
-------------

The 'Base Settings' are set once by the Site Administrator, and are not able to
be changed by any users of the system (neither normal users, nor admins).
These settings are base settings such as security keys (secret hash), usernames/passwords for
e-mail system integration, AWS S3 storage integration.

Registration-Update Scheduler
------------------------------

In order to automatically update the registration period when the current period
ends, a scheduled task must be executed daily. This is done with the 'whenever' gem
which schedules the task to run daily

Production flag
---------------

Setting this flag will remove the "Development Site" banner

    DEVELOPMENT_BANNER=false

Caching
--------

When deploying, we use a redis caching server

Email System integration
------------------------

Without a configured e-mail address, the system is unable to send confirmation
e-mails to new registrants.
The following is used to configure the outgoing e-mail system.
Specify a real email account, with username and password.
The "Full E-mail" will be the e-mail address in the "From" line.

    MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
    MAIL_PORT=587
    MAIL_DOMAIN=dunlopweb.com
    MAIL_USERNAME=robin@dunlopweb.com
    MAIL_PASSWORD=something

    MAIL_FULL_EMAIL=robin@dunlopweb.com
    or, if you want it to have a name as well as an e-mail:
    MAIL_FULL_EMAIL="NAUCC 2013 <unicycling@dunlopweb.com>"

On Non-GMail systems, you may need to set the MAIL_TLS=false variable too (see initializers/mailer.rb)

The following e-mail will receive a CC of every payment confirmation sent

    PAYMENT_NOTICE_EMAIL=robin+nauccpayments@dunlopweb.com

The following e-mail(s) will receive all error messages, "feedback", and other low-level messages

    ERROR_EMAIL=robin+nauccerrors@dunlopweb.com
    ERROR_EMAIL2=bob+nauccerrors@dunlopweb.com


The DOMAIN setting is used to build the links in the e-mails, set it to the hostname of the deployed application

    DOMAIN=uniregtest.herokuapp.com

If you want to allow user accounts to be created WITHOUT requiring e-mail
confirmation, set the following variable, or "Authorize the laptop":

    MAIL_SKIP_CONFIRMATION=true

Paypal Account
--------------

Specify the paypal account "Merchant Account" that will be paid.
Set these in your "Base Configuration" (EventConfiguration table)

  Paypal Account

Specify whether to use the LIVE or TEST PAYPAL Site (default: Test)

    Paypal Test Mode

Paypal Settings required for proper integration:

Configure your paypal account to send out IPN notifications;
  The <notification url> will be the hosted website URL, with /payments/notification at the end.
  Example: http://registrationtest.unicycling-software.com/payments/notification

. New Paypal UI: Login to the PayPal merchang account -> Click on the person icon top right next to sign out -> Profile and settings -> My selling tools -> Getting paid and managing my risk -> Instant Payment Notifications -> ...

. Old Paypal UI: Login to the PayPal merchant account -> Profile -> Instant Payment Notification Preferences -> ...

Then: Enter <notification url> and select radio button “Receive IPN messages” -> Save

Enable Auto Return:
  <return_url> will be http://registrationtest.unicycling-software.com/payments/


 New UI: Click on the person icon top right next to sign out -> Profile and settings -> My selling tools -> Selling Online -> Website prefernces -> ...

 Old UI:  "My Account -> Profile -> Sellers Preferences -> Website Payment Preferences -> ...

 Then: Payment Data Transfer (On), Auto Return ON: Return URL: <return_url>

Set the "PayPal Account Optional" setting on so that people don't have to have a paypal account to pay
  "My Account -> Profile -> Sellers Preferences -> Website Payment Preferences -> PayPal Account Optional (On) -> save"


AWS S3 Account
--------------

You should also create an Amazon S3 Account for storing files.
These files include:

 - The main app logo
 - Any uploaded Songs (if that feature is enabled)
 - PDFs of results.

Specify your connection settings in the secrets.yml file:

    aws_bucket:
    aws_access_key:
    aws_secret_access_key:


Google Analytics Account
----------------

Google Analytics is a service for tracking the way that users interact with the site.

Adding a google Analytics token enables us to track the flow of users. This setting is
optional.

    google_analytics_tracking_id=<token>

NewRelic Account
----------------

NewRelic is a performance monitoring tool, install it via the addons page, or commmand line.

Set the following settings

    NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=<key>
    NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=<name you would like to appear in NewRelic panel>

To View the local NewRelic Inforamtion

    `http://localhost:9292/newrelic` (when in development or caching modes)

Skylight
--------

We use https://skylight.io for exception and performance monitoring.

Set up a skylight account, and set the token in the config/skylight.yml file


Seed Data
---------

There are a number of tables which have non-user-editable data in them (such as
StandardSkillEntry). In order to initially populate these, please run db:seed

    $ rake db:seed

you can use the db:setup command to create the database, tables, and seed:

    $ rake db:setup


Event Configuration
-------------------

Once you have the application configured for e-mail and other 'Base Settings',
you need to configure the events offered at this particular competition, as well
as the expense details for registration.

* Create an account (using the "Sign Up" page)
* Use the "heroku console" to set this user as "super_admin: true"

     u = User.find(1); u.add_role :super_admin;

* Log into the site
 * Create an "Event Configuration" with your basic details, which includes the
   Name of the competition as well as logo and URL links to supporting
   information.
* Create some Expense Groups and Expense Items
 * Create some Registration Periods
 * Create some Categories, and Events within those categories.

Authorizing a laptop
--------------------
If you want to enable normal users to create registrations (For Example: On-Site
Registration). Go to /permissions/acl and authorize the browser.

This allows creation/modification of user-accounts/registrations for 24 hours from
this laptop.

Administrators will have access to the key necessary to enable this feature.

Development Setup instructions:
-------------------------------

To use this, you must install a local postgres database server.


Getting Started with Development
================================

Set your local git credentials
------------------------------

    $ cd ~/unicycling-registration/ (Or wherever the working directory is)

    $ git config --local user.name "Robin Dunlop" (Enter YOUR name instead)
    $ git config --local user.email robin@dunlopweb.com (Enter YOUR email instead)

Setup the database
==================
    Copy `config/database_template.yml` to `config/database.yml`  and make
      any necessary adjustments for your local environment.

Start the local server
----------------------

Create a local .env file. This file will contain some base settings.

    cd workspace
    $ echo "PORT=9292" > .env
    $ echo "RACK_ENV=development" >> .env
    $ echo "WEB_CONCURRENCY=1" >> .env

Each of the settings in the settings.yml file will need to be
configured. Some of these settings should be configured differently:

Start the server:

    $ foreman start (this will not return)

SERVER RUNNING
--------------

* When the server is running, you can access it at http://localhost:9292

Email-Service
-------------

* The server /may/ need an outgoing e-mail account in order to function nicely.

To Stop the server
------------------

* Press Ctrl-C on the Server console

If making changes to the logic
==============================

Migrate the database
--------------------
This step is necessary if you make changes to the db schema in development, or if you plan on running the server locally

(inside the VM)

    cd workspace
    rake db:migrate
    RAILS_ENV=test rake db:migrate

To Run the test suite
---------------------

    cd workspace
    rspec spec

or to run each type of test separately

    cd workspace
    bundle exec rake spec:unit
    bundle exec rake spec:integration
    bundle exec rake spec:api



In order to create a database backup from production for use on your development
system (if so desired):

    Instructions missing

* Import the data (from inside your VM)

    $ PGPASSWORD=password dropdb -U postgres -h localhost app_development
    $ PGPASSWORD=password createdb -U postgres -h localhost app_development
    $ PGPASSWORD=password pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U postgres -d app_development latest.dump

PDF Generation
==============

PDFs are generated using wicked_pdf. It is installed by a gem automatically.


To Run the Production setup locally
===================================

* Take a database snapshot
* Create a production database

    $ PGPASSWORD=password createdb -U postgres -h localhost app_production

* Import the data

    $ PGPASSWORD=password pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U postgres -d app_production latest.dump

* Precompile the assets

    $ rake assets:precompile

* Start the server

    $  foreman start web


..... Backing up the local postgres database:

    $ PGPASSWORD=password pg_dump -h localhost -U postgres -f test.dump -F t app_production

Setting the correct timezone
----------------------------

In order to have all printed reports have the correct timestamp on them, you
should set the timezone of the server.

* Run 'tzselect'
* After choosing the options, put the resulting line into ~/.profile
* Example:

    $ cat "TZ='America/New_York'; export TZ" >> ~/.profile
