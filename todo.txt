 - Use the raw files, instead of the LIF files (JCountu?)
 - Create a way for error-on-lif-import to prompt the user to map the field into a status (DNS, DNF, DQ, etc)?
- Importing results without a lane, nor a DQ, crashes the system (see Heat 13 Race 48)
- Improve the Track day data recording so that NO data has to be deleted. Perhaps mark them as "Confirmed" in order to track the agreement between judges+timers.
- Allow the "Track" importer the "ability" to Accept the results for the LIF import.
- Better handle malformed LIF data from the track timer people. (without status, what should I do?)

- Improve the Freestyle Judging Data entry, to allow easier management of judging by the Chief Judge
 - Add the Judging Reference sheets to the system?
 - Improve the ability to create judge accounts for people who don't have log-in accounts. (yet associate these accounts with their Registrants)

========================================================================================================================
Features which NAUCC would like added:
- Use new Menubar system, to allow for better responsiveness at smaller screen sizes
- make "best time" input force seconds (etc)
 - Add much more logic into the 'best time' field to help it become useful information, to be used by the system for creating start-lists, etc
- "upgrade" from non-competitor to competitor? ....some way for Admins...
- PDF filenames should use the awards names for filenames.
- Use a less-ugly looking randomizer for the pdf filename.
- Allow DNF status, which shows the result, but marks them an DNF and doesn't take any places. (see Marathon results)

- Make the music file download as a zip file, or folder file thing.
 - and rename the files so that they are in competitor order. (by file sorted order)
- Printing/entry of the Heat Data (gear/crank) is sorted incorrectly where there are heat times also).
- If I change a TimeResult from DQ to not-DQ, it doesn't cause the competitor to be updated/touched.
- Allow DNS, DNF
- Fix the "Display Candidates -> create heat" to allow un-selecting peoplo for the heat (male and female heat separately)
- For Trials Finals, put the Expert Male and Expert Female separately, with a small heading in front of each.
- When doing MUNI data entry, it should easily allow changing the result to be "this competition" instead of auto-adding to another event. Perhaps make the auto-select-event a feature flag?
- Feedback from Chris Hugo, The "Manage Competitors" button is not clearly the next action I need to do.
 - make it more obvious.

========================================================================================================================

Other Notes:

Registrant Summary of results. Notes:
  per event:

  - Event name
  - result (time/points)
  - Expert placing
  - Age group name
  - Age group placing

Possibly store all published results 2x. Once with a TOD, once without any random characters (just "Trials_results.pdf"). This way, any sharing of the link will be to the same-named file at all times
 - Additionally, we are able to keep around all previously published results, for reference by admins, if desired/needed.

what is uni-alpha? (same as 'unicycling', but with less (no) data)
what is unicycling? (naucc2012 Standard Skill routine entry menu)
========================================================================================================================
========================================================================================================================

    t.integer  "riding_wheel_size"
    t.string   "notes"
    t.integer  "heat"
    t.integer  "riding_crank_size" into a separate table, has_one relationship
- How did Mimi import results as Robin?

Feature:
- # results for High/Long judges should show the number of unique competitors each judge has entered? (right now it's 0)
- Make the UI of the High/Long data entry more usable.

Track day to-do:
- make the results text smaller (fewer printed sheets)
- Ensure that Multiple Heat#1 doesn't break the importer.
- combine the DQ with the data-DQ, so that only a single row appears. (or allow multiple rows to exist?)
- Disable the "next heat is in...<category>" function.
- create role for importing the data?
- create role for teh ipads?
- Recalculating the results is too long (difficult to take the system down that long)

- Create a new Falls-

- Patricia Feature: Competitior Management Page, there is still a red warning if their partner isn't signed up for that competition which makes it unclear whether the person isn't signed up at all or if they are just in another age group. Robin: Make it clearer when a registrant is in a different filter vs when they are in this pairs-age-group.

- Remove all Boundary Score calculation logic, replace it with a new judge type, which affects "Presentation" Judge-type display.
- Hugo: we need to e-mail all <10 age people to have them tell us what size of wheel they plan on riding in the track and muni and distance events.

BUG- Unable to enter external Result with a DQ (the "not qualifieD" of the Competitor doesn't seem to take effect over the external result
BUG- how can I manage ALL distance attempts (to edit/delete) to fix problems with the data?

- Mass Start Sign-in list should include blank lines for people who are not signed up.(10)
- needa bility to select and delete multiple entries from the awards labels page.
- Idea: make it not allowed to put a DQ for a higher attempt without first marking sccess at the present level.

- The awards are still printing a little off the labels at times
- In the 50m WW, why doesn't a 20" able to compete? Is it the size of the cranks.

- USA membershp page, allow easy adding/editing of USA# to a reg.
- Allow easy way to export the list of e-mails of those who remain.
- Test importing CSV file.
- Test DataEntry Import Results Destroy All action.

Jim:
- When registering, invalid Country says "2 errors" when there is only 1

Kathleen notes:
 - Filters for Heat/age-group (filter before-and-after Heat # X)
 Done- Put the Heat/Lane/ID/Name/age/age-group/Gender, (because it doesn't need to be sorted by ID)
 - When re-sorting, some of the data goes away.
 - color-code filled-heats.
  - Use a "show Heat X and above text-area"
 - "Is tehre a way to put a Line between each Heat?"
  - Perhaps remove all of the sortability, and only make it prettier, using dark-lines between heats.


===== Questions to be answered, by whom
- Connie/Patricia/Hugo/Benoit - What are the age groups for the events at NAUCC, and at UNICON?
 - Who should be able to modify the age group entries? (we usually share age groups among competitions...so I don't want to be able to change them once they are in use, right?)
  - Use the sign-up-lists should be enough.
  - Directors should NOT be able to set age groups. Admin should be able to set age groups.
- Connie: when should the Overall Champion calculation be updated? Whenever data is entered? approved? published? awarded?
 - Only show this when ALL of the input competitions are "Published"
- Should we change the way that the data recording forms are written for NAUCC?
 - On the Competitors List:
  - Split it by ID only, then record their 2 times
  - See the gender of the competition, or split the competitors by gender.
- Connie/Scott: Rulebook question: can a 0-10 20” racing-categroy competitor win the expert slow… If so, then any competitor (no matter what wheel) can win. Expert will be non-wheel-size.
 - Answer: no. it cannot.
 -  "** Calculation of the Experts cannot use results which are in the 20"or 16" category."
  - ANSWER: to solve this, only peopleo on 24" wheels will have an "overall_place" for 100m.
- Connie: How does the "Overall Track" calculation work when there is a Tie? (ie: tie for 1st, do both get 8 points, or do they split 8+6=14, thus 7 points each)
 - ANSWER Both get 8.
- Connie: Distance Champion: are 10k Standard placers eligible to qualify? (or do we just include the Unlimited?)
 - ANswer: no.
- Connie, should I prioritize the ability to specify the Age Group Order, for printing at the Track? (I think it will be confusing/difficult to deal with...but actually may be useful to be able to communicate with Competitors, Race Officials, etc?)
 - ANSWER: Yes, add an ability to order these for printing/display.
- Scott/Connie:
  Section 2.1.4 (page 26)
 - If Scott and Robin compete in 100m, and 1st (32 seconds) and 2nd (33 seconds) respectively
 - And then they both compete in the finals, and have results of Scott: 31 seconds, Robin: 30 seconds.
 THEN: What is the time and place awarded to Scott and Robin for the Age Group? (is it 1st/2nd, or 2nd/1st)
 - ANswer: Age group results are based on Age GRoup data.

- Connie, how difficult will it be to do Expert T-Shirts?
 - Answer: it would be nice to do this in advance.
- Connie what data do we need to be able to expert nicely, in case there are issues with the system?
 - Answer: I need the raw data.
 -  Answer: I would like to expose a form of this for every director.
- Connie: Talk about Hockey and sensitive data.
 - Educate the admin people that they cannot give away information.
  - Why/who was able to export the dataset.


- Patricia - Will there be a judge of "Falls" for "Group/Club"?
 -  "Major and Minor faults are counted by 2 people and averaged, and then those scores are used by all of the judegs.""

- Scott/Hugo/benoit - UNICON rule: Scott, can we add a rule to Trials for tie-breakers, so that we know that people need to be present for tie-breaking.

================================================================================================
===== Development Items that MUST be done before we do another run-through/demo

===== Really Easy & High Imapact
- Write e-mails to various people:
 - Directors (all). Welcome, here's what I'm planning
 - Track e-timer...using sample data.
 -
- Print the Registration packages, alphabetical by last name.
- Send Mike a set of instructions for how to train Directors for using the system.
- Add ability for Mary to know when Results are posted.
 - Email.
- 100m breadcrumbs on "display heat"
- Add ability to search for registrants by name, instead of always by ID. (wherever we do registrant-choosing). perhaps via a javascript helper function or something.
- Make it possible/easy for a Director to access the raw data (time_results/external_results) after importing
 - Make this transition of data clearer/better.
- Excel export of Competitior lists, for Hugo/E-Timer People ((nom, prenom, sexe, categorie, dossard))
 - Also have the "Event Report" be exported in Excel format
- Migrate the Judging Types to include the new ranges as per the new rulebook.
 - Freestyle Presentation scores are only 3 categories (not 4)
- Have a tablet at the start time which shows the HEAT number, Age Group, Event, Competitors (Large ID, Large First, (small Last))
 - Formatting

==== Important
- Fix Import results CSV to allow for Mac-based CSV files (not windows-only)
  - Why can't I import the 10kStandard.csv (file format issues?)
- Have a way to publish results for a single Age group (for 100m, for example), while the competition itself continues to run.
DONE - When publishing 100m results, have a different PDF for each age group, “50+ Female”
DONE - So, only publish the “Per Event” PDF after the event is over, but have “50+ “ and “40+ “ separately while the event is running.
  - Change the “Competition Status” to be less granular…perhaps “Unstarted, Started, and Completed”.
  - When publishing the 100m results by age group, also have the ability to see the results overall (without age groups)
  - Print/display/results by age group
 - Determine who will be doing the 100m Review/Publish datastep
 - When/how do we publish 100m results?
 - Able to assign "Track Data Importer" role
- Able to assign "High/Long" data importer role (????already done via a judge?)
  - and prevent them from adding scores after the event is "locked"
- Ensure that a Judge cannot update their score after the event is Locked.
- Make it impossible for more import results to be entered once an event has been locked also.
- Handle Multi-lap race recording/calculation/reporting
  - Num Laps for time results (Coker MUni cross)

================================================================================================
===== Development Items which MUST be done before NAUCC (but colud be after the demo)

- Add ability for a registrant to sign-up on-site using a laptop (use a "modification access code")
- Add abilty for modifications to be done on-site also, using a laptop + "Modification access code"
- LOCK Artistic changes, so that they cannot be done after the artistic closed date.

- Pages for Track Data Importing:
 - 1 Choose the Heat, and the file
 - 2. Import the data from the file, and see all the other data that has been entered for this heat. (by seeing the lane_assignment-data for this heat)
 - 3. Allow adjustments to the imported data (8-rows)
 - 4. Approve/import the data, (?thus removing it from the import_results?)
 - 5. Proceed by loading the next heat file (auto-increment the heat#)

- Prevent "final_candidates" from being selected from non-24" wheel-sizes

- Need a way to Display the results of a Combined competition (and publish them)
- need a way to print awards for a Combined Competition
- Add indicator to the Import Results page which shows whether the given competitor already has a result record stored (this would be a BAD thing)

===== Configuration items
- Configure all competitinos for UNICON, including assigning directors to events, and sending them welcome e-mails asking them to begin assigning registrants to competitions.
 - Ask them also for the breakdowns of their competitions (as applicable)

===== Development Items that must be done for UNICON, but NOT NAUCC

====== High Impact & Low Effort
- Fix printing of PDFs with special characters (ie: french characters) (already Done? need to test)
- Ensure that when placing competitors, if they have no time/data they have a place of 0 with status DNF?
- A way to print out the Judging Sheets for Freestyle, for Paper-recording (later to be transcribed into UDA)
- In Group Competitior, it would be nice to have “number of people in group” (when displaying)
- Create an "Announcer" role which has access to all of the music, and the competitor lists.

====== Important, but difficult:
- Add a way to display the overall places for 100m on the Results page (to help people identify the "Finalists")
- Improve the Excel Data import functions
- Allow Pre-Assigning Heats for Competitions easily
 - Perhaps a view of exported data for the signed-up competitors would be sufficient?
 - 10k - Print/export registrant data with Best Time (for use by chief judge when creating start-lists).
- Add the "DNS" and "DNF" states to a competitor, and to import_results.

===== Low Importance
- Test the use of HTML5 forms in other browsers
  - When trying to type a long number in the seconds column, it would silently not allow me to submit.
 - Install a set of fallbacks?
 - Install something which does autoprefixing/etc?
- Improve the performance of the site:
 - CompetitionsController#result
 - WelcomeController#data_entry_menu
 - CompetitionsController#show
 - Printing::CompetitionsController#single_attempt_recording (CompetitionSignUp)
 - Fix/add caching of competition_source counts, so that it is updated when a new registrant signs up, or a new result occurs in a dependent competition....(how should this work? ...especially with the gender filter applied)
 - Counter_caches?
 - NAUCC 2013 registrants#show_all doesn't work (too slow)

- Improve the styling of the Single Data Entry PDF:
 - Single Data entry PDF is 3 lines onto page #2.
 - Should we make it a long PDF with multiple pages.
 - Maybe make it number of competitors x2.
 - And put the Header on every page.


=================================================
====== Nice to have =======================

====== High Impact & Low Effort
- Relabel "Continue (Expenses)" to "Save and Continue (Expenses)""
- Have pre-filled options for the DQ Comment.
- Log all logs to an external (persistent) store
- Run a report of all <=10 year olds, so that we can identify the wheel size that they will be competing on for their various events
 - Perhaps have this highlight their registration package sheet?
- Online system which allows the public to see the Competitor List for each event.
- Per Registrant Results pages.
- Create "Participation Cerificate" which lists each Competitor's all results
(email) Notify certain people whenever an event has been approved/locked.
- Add a "Refresh" button to every page (which just reloads the page)
- Group Freestyle (and other non-age-group-having competitions): “Age Group" column is unnecessary
- List all Event Categories, and show which competition they are associated with. (Each should be associated with at least 1)
- List all Age Groups, and their assigned Competitions, and the resulting # of people in each age group?
 - Connie to help with this design.
 - fix problems when the age groups are not large enough, or when a person's age is >100 (and out of range of the age groups) (problems printing PDFs, etc)
- Make the breadcrumbs sticky.
- see competitors without data and data without competitors before "approving (importing)
- see data by heat (admin-only).

====== Difficult
- Enter start times, with the same start time for many people
- mark comptitor as no-show
- Fix problem when typing in value for "position" and getting it wrong (and it breaks the system)
- Create "Expert T-Shirt" calculation system
- Create "Personalized Schedule" for each competitor
- Change the SCSS include layout so that I can start building common styling elements, like @work.
 - set up scss stylesheets to properly inherit variables/mixins.
 - Fix image path in scss references (compiled vs dev)
- Build a similar TwoAttemptEntry Review/Approve set (like the Single/ImportResult ones)
- enable feature test for two-attempt-entry. (needs JS)
- insteall simple_form_for (for two-attempt-entry form, to help with error reporting?)
- Show the "attempt number" which was faster.
- 100m import action should only allow if it matches the heat data
 - Import action without approval results in all heat entries having data (due to DNS/DNF/DQ)
- Who gets expert T-Shirts?
 - Pick the events that qualify for an expert t-shirt
  - Determine who came in top-3, and then combine all of these people into a list.
  - List the shirt-size for each of these competitors.
  - Allow adding another competition if there are still shirts/etc.

 - “Create/Sort Competitors” should be more obvious.

- Would it be possible to sort in HTML and Then export to PDF.
- Move the "PDF" link to be inside the HTML form on all pages, instead of next to the HTML pageview link.
- When publishing results, warn if there is missing data (what constitutes missing data?, but allow Admins to publish the results anyways (though other roles need to fix the data).

ADMIN Config-Watching View:
- add warning on the "Registrants (edit)" page for any registrant which is "Not Valid"

==========================================================
Rulebook Comments (after having read through it once)
==========================================================
What is the way in which the High/Long competition will be run?
Connie has ideas about the “most efficient” way of running it. Who is the director, and how do they think it should be run?

Scott: section 4.6 Age Groups (Muni)
There are the age groups that must be used for Muni? (it seems to indicate this by saying "The following age groups are the maximum allowable for muni competitions:”


Section 5.7 Announcing of Results (Freestyle)
This seems to say that we are required to continuously announce the results of the judging. We have always restricted this information until after the awards. Is this still planned to be done?

Scetion 5.23 Individual Freestyle - Technical Score
Should "The Technical part of the judging is broken into four parts” be “three parts”?


5.25.1 Pairs Freestyle: Quantity of Unicycling Skills and Transitions

This section feels like it needs some grammatical correction.





===========================================================
Behaviour comments abotu Data Entry:
===========================================================
When doing data entry, adding data:
Only seeing the first set of data when there is more than 2 data entries for the same person.
The “search” box is being cut off because the footer is overlapping.
Single data entry, can we put the error box near the submit instead of the top.
When an error occurs, put the focus on the first box that is missing.
The error shouldn’t “or rank” because it doesn’t exist here
Don’t allow tab to the competition rulebook.
When there is double-entry it should be highlighted.
