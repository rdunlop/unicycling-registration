 - Create pre-configured event types (100m, Marathon, etc) which can be chosen for inclusion in a convention
 - Guide a user through the creation of a Convention
- Make the site more robust when creating/deleting expense items/registration periods (scott broke it easily by deleting an expense item, I think)
- Allow administrators to reset passwords on user accounts.
- Add ability to reset user's email password by admin-level people
- UI for setting a user's registration period to be locked into previous period.
-BUG: prevent selecting dates which are not possible (Scott problem).

#2 - Translate Frontend
- Translate the whole Front End,
 - translate the volunteer options form
 - translate the volunteer options form text fields
 - Enable easier switching between language choices.
 - Add translations for Spanish, French, German, Japanese
- drop the base columns for the translated attributes?

- Translate the whole back-end
 - translate into German, Spanish, French, Japanese
- Change "add Attempt" to "Enter Attempt"

#4 - Self-Serve configuration of competition
- allow directors to set competitor heat/etc.
- Directors should NOT be able to set age groups. Admin should be able to set age groups.
- Able to assign "High/Long" data importer role (????already done via a judge?)
  - and prevent them from adding scores after the event is "locked"
- Ensure that a Judge cannot update their score after the event is Locked.
- Make it impossible for more import results to be entered once an event has been locked also.
- UI for using the "International (Ineligible)" selection for registrants.
-BUG: Add ability to fix typo in user's name (when assigning data entry volunteers)

 - Be able to extract the base details from the IUF database when the user has entered their information.
 - Be able to re-sync the data back into IUF database?

#6 - External Result import/export
-BUG: Fix the "Download Results" excel export. 1) too slow. 2) Doesn't work (excel download fail...like at unicon).
-BUG: Unable to use the export functions (doesn't like transferring that much data over the response?)
- Allow Excel import of data for Timing. (like export the Two Attepmt entry document.) (same with bottom of the hill "Single attempt")
- Import Heat#s (id,heat#)
 - Matching Export function?
- Expose a raw export of the data for each Director, of every event.
 - This may be multiple files, depending on the competition.
- Expose a raw import of the data for each event?
- Handle Multi-lap race recording/calculation/reporting
  - Num Laps for time results (Coker MUni cross)
BUG- Unable to enter external Result with a DQ (the "not qualifieD" of the Competitor doesn't seem to take effect over the external result
BUG- how can I manage ALL distance attempts (to edit/delete) to fix problems with the data?

#7 - E-Track Improvements
- Improve the Track e-timer import process, so that it is less labor intensive, and less error prone
 - Use the raw files, instead of the LIF files (JCountu?)
 - Create a way for error-on-lif-import to prompt the user to map the field into a status (DNS, DNF, DQ, etc)?
- Allow importing system to automatically change/choose the competition (based on lane-assignments)
- Importing results without a lane, nor a DQ, crashes the system (see Heat 13 Race 48)
- Improve the Track day data recording so that NO data has to be deleted. Perhaps mark them as "Confirmed" in order to track the agreement between judges+timers.
- Allow the "Track" importer the "ability" to Accept the results for the LIF import.
- Better handle malformed LIF data from the track timer people. (without status, what should I do?)
- Track Import -  combine the DQ with the data-DQ, so that only a single row appears. (or allow multiple rows to exist?)
- Track Import - When the importer chooses to "restart", only THEIR results should be deleted. (we delete the line-judge's results too..
- Track - Ensure that Multiple Heat#1 doesn't break the importer.
- 100m import action should only allow if it matches the heat data
 - Import action without approval results in all heat entries having data (due to DNS/DNF/DQ)
- Don't allow another import to overwrite an existing TimeResult.
- Pages for Track Data Importing:
 - 1 Choose the Heat, and the file
 - 2. Import the data from the file, and see all the other data that has been entered for this heat. (by seeing the lane_assignment-data for this heat)
 - 3. Allow adjustments to the imported data (8-rows)
 - 4. Approve/import the data, (?thus removing it from the import_results?)
 - 5. Proceed by loading the next heat file (auto-increment the heat#)
- allow deirectors to Make Changes for LaneAssignment
- BUG: if the competitor DQs and re-runs, both results are marked as DQ for some reason. (Lucas Clegg)
- BUG: Edit COmptetitor didn't change the name of the competitor.
- BUG: When doing an import Lif without choosing a file, it fails.

#8 - Freestyle Improvements

- On the Judge Management page, the Tech/Pres categories should be ordered (not swap sides randomly)
- Make the Judges-chooser alphabetical, and Chosen.
- Patricia - Will there be a judge of "Falls" for "Group/Club"?
 -  "Major and Minor faults are counted by 2 people and averaged, and then those scores are used by all of the judegs.""
- Create a new Falls-Judge
- falls count judging,

- Allow directors to use the Heats menus
- Create "Emergency Contact Info" report PDF which we print for having on-site at each of the competitions.
 - ID, Name, Gender, Age, Phone, Club, Country, Emergency Contact, Name, Phone, Attending?
- need a way to be able to add a payment item to a registrant (as a payment_admin, onsite).
- Can we have the onsite people approve the things that they can buy?
 - Unicon: benoit/hugo want to be able to calc prices(incl tax) easily, but also control who can buy what.
- Should force each competitor to choose their t-shirt size OR choose not to have a t-shirt when giving everyone a t-shirt as part of registration.
- When randomly-sorting, it should return to the same page

- Configurable: Disable the "auto-matching to another competition" feature. Make this ONLY available for 10k.
- Patricia Feature: Competitior Management Page, there is still a red warning if their partner isn't signed up for that competition which makes it unclear whether the person isn't signed up at all or if they are just in another age group.

Possibly store all published results 2x. Once with a TOD, once without any random characters (just "Trials_results.pdf"). This way, any sharing of the link will be to the same-named file at all times
 - Additionally, we are able to keep around all previously published results, for reference by admins, if desired/needed.

what is uni-alpha? (same as 'unicycling', but with less (no) data)

- Slopestyle Street:
5 judges, each judge scores the competitor by:
 - Variety (/10)
 - Consistency (/10)
 - Difficulty (/10)
A super-judge by Time:
 - Time (/5, fastest=5, slowest=0)

- In the 50m WW, why doesn't a 20" able to compete? Is it the size of the cranks.

- Wheel Walk results show doesn't Experts vs not, in order to be able to differenciate.
  - Also decide whether Experts should be 1 or 2 (m/f) competitions.
- better way to do in-place sorting than the current age-group-type sorting.

- Connie/Scott: Rulebook question: can a 0-10 20” racing-categroy competitor win the expert slow… If so, then any competitor (no matter what wheel) can win. Expert will be non-wheel-size.
 - Answer: no. it cannot.
 -  "** Calculation of the Experts cannot use results which are in the 20"or 16" category."
  - ANSWER: to solve this, only peopleo on 24" wheels will have an "overall_place" for 100m.
 - IS THIS CLEAR AND CODIFIED?


- Should we change the way that the data recording forms are written for NAUCC?
 - On the Competitors List:
  - Split it by ID only, then record their 2 times
  - See the gender of the competition, or split the competitors by gender.

===========================================================
Behaviour comments abotu Data Entry:
===========================================================
When doing data entry, adding data:
Only seeing the first set of data when there is more than 2 data entries for the same person.
The “search” box is being cut off because the footer is overlapping.
Single data entry, can we put the error box near the submit instead of the top.
When an error occurs, put the focus on the first box that is missing.
The error shouldn’t “or rank” because it doesn’t exist here
Don’t allow tab to the competition rulebook.
When there is double-entry it should be highlighted.

========================================================================================================================
Rulebook Rule changes desired:

- Add a rulebook rule for how to cut off the ends of High/Long competition (you are allowed to jump...forever?)
- add recommendations for how to schedule an event, including awarding younger riders' awards earlier, and not performing awards the same evening as an event.
- add recommendation for scheduling event to include always having water stations, clearly labeled bathrooms, and announcing medical services are available, where.

- Scott/Hugo/benoit - UNICON rule: Scott, can we add a rule to Trials for tie-breakers, so that we know that people need to be present for tie-breaking.


What is the way in which the High/Long competition will be run?
Connie has ideas about the “most efficient” way of running it. Who is the director, and how do they think it should be run?

Scott: section 4.6 Age Groups (Muni)
There are the age groups that must be used for Muni? (it seems to indicate this by saying "The following age groups are the maximum allowable for muni competitions:”


Section 5.7 Announcing of Results (Freestyle)
This seems to say that we are required to continuously announce the results of the judging. We have always restricted this information until after the awards. Is this still planned to be done?

Scetion 5.23 Individual Freestyle - Technical Score
Should "The Technical part of the judging is broken into four parts” be “three parts”?


5.25.1 Pairs Freestyle: Quantity of Unicycling Skills and Transitions

This section feels like it needs some grammatical correction.
