Last Re-Arranged June 20th, 2014.

- Run/resolve consistency_fail errors
- Add a per-competitor report
- Allow DNF status, which shows the result, but marks them an DNF and doesn't take any places. (see Marathon results)
- Only print the # of laps if it is fewer than the max # laps.
- Time REsults Edit should have penalties (WTF robin)
- Allow specifying the precision of expected data input (thousands, or hundreds, and REQUIRE that many digits)
- What overall awards are required to be calculated/posted for Unicon?
- Change the URL format for various pages, so that it's nicer/more descriptive (like using the bib number, or the event name?)
- Add a count of compettitors to the sign up lists (public display)
- Allow entering a penalty for Slow Races, which then subtracts a second for each penalty.
- Re-Work the slow-race data entry (as per Scott).
- Add a "Deploy on Heroku" button?
- Setting places for a 10 person Pairs routine takes too long (> 30 seconds)
- Why doesn't the artistic summary show the places? (make it print ordered by place, and then remove the top summary?)

- Allow multi-delete of award labels
- Fix the header/grouping on the PDFs for headers.
- Fix the "Source from Competition" when doing Group competitions...it doesn't allow creation of groups (only indiduals)
- Add the times to the relay results printouts (age group specific)
- Improve the Track day data recording so that NO data has to be deleted. Perhaps mark them as "Confirmed" in order to track the agreement between judges+timers.
- Allow the "Track" importer the "ability" to Accept the results for the LIF import.
- Better handle malformed LIF data from the track timer people. (without status, what should I do?)
- allow marking a registrant as DNF (or some way of making that clearer when doing data entry of single-data results)
- figure out how to let the IUF slalom results (555 results) be imported in < 30 seconds, and be scored in < 30 seconds. (really really long).
- Disallow setting a val_1_max > 99, as it doesn't work in the database storage (exception when trying to store score of 100). Or expand the range of the score value fields.
- allow modification of the selected registrant when doing "Edit" of imported results...so that we can adjust it while doing "import somewhere else" imports. (like Muni XC)
- Add HighlightIfDuplicate to the StreetScore judging page. (for ties)
- Fix RailsAdmin by dealing with DqRequest circular dependency?
- Remove leading 0 in stillstand results. was hundreds, not thousands.

Robin's Todo List tomorrow:

- Add ability to reset user's email password by admin-level people
-

- Heat/Lane auto-assignment takes >30 seconds with >300 competitors
- Add a page which lists the High/Long result which require tie breaks (top 3 places which are tie, by age group results)
- Add a rulebook rule for how to cut off the ends of High/Long competition (you are allowed to jump...forever?)
- add recommendations for how to schedule an event, including awarding younger riders' awards earlier, and not performing awards the same evening as an event.
- add recommendation for scheduling event to include always having water stations, clearly labeled bathrooms, and announcing medical services are available, where.

    t.boolean  "geared",                   default: false
    t.integer  "riding_wheel_size"
    t.string   "notes"

- make hours and minutes and seconds line up properly. (so that 1 hour (without miliseconds) and minutes (with miliseconds) show up more clearly.
- make the "Mark as inactive" clearer for admin users, when managing Freestyle competitors, so that we don't "delete" competitors after they have started judging (for clarity).

Track day to-do:
- make the results text smaller (fewer printed sheets)
- Ensure that Multiple Heat#1 doesn't break the importer.

- Ensure that the results-caching files work
- Get a test file from the timers which has DNS/DNF/etc
- create role for importing the data?
- create role for teh ipads?

BUGS:
- Caching on the Registrant#summary is broken, it doesn't notice changes to the competitor (only changes to the member).
- When a registrant loads the /edit page, and they get an error on submit, frequently they get another "event choice has already been taken" error when the subsequently try saving.
- Really Really slow Heat assignment
- Slow Lane Assign updating (because of the re-display, not because of the update itself?)

===== Questions to be answered, by whom
- Connie/Patricia/Hugo/Benoit - What are the age groups for the events at NAUCC, and at UNICON?
 - Who should be able to modify the age group entries? (we usually share age groups among competitions...so I don't want to be able to change them once they are in use, right?)
  - Use the sign-up-lists should be enough.
  - Directors should NOT be able to set age groups. Admin should be able to set age groups.
- Connie: when should the Overall Champion calculation be updated? Whenever data is entered? approved? published? awarded?
 - Only show this when ALL of the input competitions are "Published"
- Should we change the way that the data recording forms are written for NAUCC?
 - On the Competitors List:
  - Split it by ID only, then record their 2 times
  - See the gender of the competition, or split the competitors by gender.
- Connie/Scott: Rulebook question: can a 0-10 20” racing-categroy competitor win the expert slow… If so, then any competitor (no matter what wheel) can win. Expert will be non-wheel-size.
 - Answer: no. it cannot.
 -  "** Calculation of the Experts cannot use results which are in the 20"or 16" category."
  - ANSWER: to solve this, only peopleo on 24" wheels will have an "overall_place" for 100m.
- Connie: How does the "Overall Track" calculation work when there is a Tie? (ie: tie for 1st, do both get 8 points, or do they split 8+6=14, thus 7 points each)
 - ANSWER Both get 8.
- Connie: Distance Champion: are 10k Standard placers eligible to qualify? (or do we just include the Unlimited?)
 - ANswer: no.
- Connie, should I prioritize the ability to specify the Age Group Order, for printing at the Track? (I think it will be confusing/difficult to deal with...but actually may be useful to be able to communicate with Competitors, Race Officials, etc?)
 - ANSWER: Yes, add an ability to order these for printing/display.
- Scott/Connie:
  Section 2.1.4 (page 26)
 - If Scott and Robin compete in 100m, and 1st (32 seconds) and 2nd (33 seconds) respectively
 - And then they both compete in the finals, and have results of Scott: 31 seconds, Robin: 30 seconds.
 THEN: What is the time and place awarded to Scott and Robin for the Age Group? (is it 1st/2nd, or 2nd/1st)
 - ANswer: Age group results are based on Age GRoup data.

- Connie, how difficult will it be to do Expert T-Shirts?
 - Answer: it would be nice to do this in advance.
- Connie what data do we need to be able to expert nicely, in case there are issues with the system?
 - Answer: I need the raw data.
 -  Answer: I would like to expose a form of this for every director.
- Connie: Talk about Hockey and sensitive data.
 - Educate the admin people that they cannot give away information.
  - Why/who was able to export the dataset.


- Patricia - Will there be a judge of "Falls" for "Group/Club"?
 -  "Major and Minor faults are counted by 2 people and averaged, and then those scores are used by all of the judegs.""

- Benoit/Scott/Patricia - do you see value in allowing UDA to show the Competitor List for each event.
 - Yes, do expose this to the public. Id, name, age-group, country, state, team.
- Hugo/Benoit -  Relay, does 4x100 compete by wheel-size /age group, or against everyone?
- Hugo/Benoit/Ptricia - What "Overall Champions" do you want at NAUCC/UNICON, and what calculation would you like used for this? (the rulebook only lists Track)
- Patricia/NAUCC-director: Patricia: what is the NAUCC rules for Trials? Hand-vs-not-hands? (how are points calculated?)
- Patricia, Mary, do you have a summary of the awards that you are expecting to give out?

- Mary, when are we printing the registartion sheets?
 - We want this done by Thursday night. Robin will e-mail people.

- Spencer Hotchberg - director of Flatland, please check with him for the scoring/needs of his event, for “Double elimination”.
 - What e-scoring do you want/need?

- Scott, I have some comments/questions about the IUF Rulebook, can I send them your way?
- Scott/Hugo/benoit - UNICON rule: Scott, can we add a rule to Trials for tie-breakers, so that we know that people need to be present for tie-breaking.

- Hugo/Benoit: What have you allocated for Awards? Can you send me a breakdown? Will it be medals? what size? for which places for which event? Are you giving out ribbons for Basketball/Hockey B-League? etc etc

- Hugo/Benoit (or the specific Director) - What is X-Style, judging-related.
- Hugo/Benoit: how are you recording Slow Races? Do you have E-Timer for that?
- Hugo/Benoit - Are they running Standard Skill without Data?

================================================================================================
===== Development Items that MUST be done before we do another run-through/demo

===== Really Easy & High Imapact
- Write e-mails to various people:
 - Directors (all). Welcome, here's what I'm planning
 - Track e-timer...using sample data.
 -
- Print the Registration packages, alphabetical by last name.
- Send Mike a set of instructions for how to train Directors for using the system.
- Add ability for Mary to know when Results are posted.
 - Email.
- 100m breadcrumbs on "display heat"
- Add ability to search for registrants by name, instead of always by ID. (wherever we do registrant-choosing). perhaps via a javascript helper function or something.
- Make it possible/easy for a Director to access the raw data (time_results/external_results) after importing
 - Make this transition of data clearer/better.
- Excel export of Competitior lists, for Hugo/E-Timer People ((nom, prenom, sexe, categorie, dossard))
 - Also have the "Event Report" be exported in Excel format
- Migrate the Judging Types to include the new ranges as per the new rulebook.
 - Freestyle Presentation scores are only 3 categories (not 4)
- Have a tablet at the start time which shows the HEAT number, Age Group, Event, Competitors (Large ID, Large First, (small Last))
 - Formatting

==== Important
- Fix Import results CSV to allow for Mac-based CSV files (not windows-only)
  - Why can't I import the 10kStandard.csv (file format issues?)
- Have a way to publish results for a single Age group (for 100m, for example), while the competition itself continues to run.
DONE - When publishing 100m results, have a different PDF for each age group, “50+ Female”
DONE - So, only publish the “Per Event” PDF after the event is over, but have “50+ “ and “40+ “ separately while the event is running.
  - Change the “Competition Status” to be less granular…perhaps “Unstarted, Started, and Completed”.
  - When publishing the 100m results by age group, also have the ability to see the results overall (without age groups)
  - Print/display/results by age group
 - Determine who will be doing the 100m Review/Publish datastep
 - When/how do we publish 100m results?
 - Able to assign "Track Data Importer" role
- Able to assign "High/Long" data importer role (????already done via a judge?)
  - and prevent them from adding scores after the event is "locked"
- Ensure that a Judge cannot update their score after the event is Locked.
- Make it impossible for more import results to be entered once an event has been locked also.
- Handle Multi-lap race recording/calculation/reporting
  - Num Laps for time results (Coker MUni cross)

================================================================================================
===== Development Items which MUST be done before NAUCC (but colud be after the demo)

- Add ability for a registrant to sign-up on-site using a laptop (use a "modification access code")
- Add abilty for modifications to be done on-site also, using a laptop + "Modification access code"
- LOCK Artistic changes, so that they cannot be done after the artistic closed date.

- Pages for Track Data Importing:
 - 1 Choose the Heat, and the file
 - 2. Import the data from the file, and see all the other data that has been entered for this heat. (by seeing the lane_assignment-data for this heat)
 - 3. Allow adjustments to the imported data (8-rows)
 - 4. Approve/import the data, (?thus removing it from the import_results?)
 - 5. Proceed by loading the next heat file (auto-increment the heat#)

- Prevent "final_candidates" from being selected from non-24" wheel-sizes

- Need a way to Display the results of a Combined competition (and publish them)
- need a way to print awards for a Combined Competition
- Add indicator to the Import Results page which shows whether the given competitor already has a result record stored (this would be a BAD thing)

===== Configuration items
- Configure all competitinos for UNICON, including assigning directors to events, and sending them welcome e-mails asking them to begin assigning registrants to competitions.
 - Ask them also for the breakdowns of their competitions (as applicable)

===== Development Items that must be done for UNICON, but NOT NAUCC

====== High Impact & Low Effort
- Fix printing of PDFs with special characters (ie: french characters) (already Done? need to test)
- Ensure that when placing competitors, if they have no time/data they have a place of 0 with status DNF?
- A way to print out the Judging Sheets for Freestyle, for Paper-recording (later to be transcribed into UDA)
- In Group Competitior, it would be nice to have “number of people in group” (when displaying)
- Create an "Announcer" role which has access to all of the music, and the competitor lists.

====== Important, but difficult:
- Add a way to display the overall places for 100m on the Results page (to help people identify the "Finalists")
- Improve the Excel Data import functions
- Allow Pre-Assigning Heats for Competitions easily
 - Perhaps a view of exported data for the signed-up competitors would be sufficient?
 - 10k - Print/export registrant data with Best Time (for use by chief judge when creating start-lists).
- Add the "DNS" and "DNF" states to a competitor, and to import_results.

===== Low Importance
- Test the use of HTML5 forms in other browsers
  - When trying to type a long number in the seconds column, it would silently not allow me to submit.
 - Install a set of fallbacks?
 - Install something which does autoprefixing/etc?
- Improve the performance of the site:
 - CompetitionsController#result
 - WelcomeController#data_entry_menu
 - CompetitionsController#show
 - Printing::CompetitionsController#single_attempt_recording (CompetitionSignUp)
 - Fix/add caching of competition_source counts, so that it is updated when a new registrant signs up, or a new result occurs in a dependent competition....(how should this work? ...especially with the gender filter applied)
 - Counter_caches?
 - NAUCC 2013 registrants#show_all doesn't work (too slow)

- Improve the styling of the Single Data Entry PDF:
 - Single Data entry PDF is 3 lines onto page #2.
 - Should we make it a long PDF with multiple pages.
 - Maybe make it number of competitors x2.
 - And put the Header on every page.


=================================================
====== Nice to have =======================

====== High Impact & Low Effort
- Relabel "Continue (Expenses)" to "Save and Continue (Expenses)""
- Have pre-filled options for the DQ Comment.
- Log all logs to an external (persistent) store
- Run a report of all <=10 year olds, so that we can identify the wheel size that they will be competing on for their various events
 - Perhaps have this highlight their registration package sheet?
- Online system which allows the public to see the Competitor List for each event.
- Per Registrant Results pages.
- Create "Participation Cerificate" which lists each Competitor's all results
(email) Notify certain people whenever an event has been approved/locked.
- Add a "Refresh" button to every page (which just reloads the page)
- Group Freestyle (and other non-age-group-having competitions): “Age Group" column is unnecessary
- List all Event Categories, and show which competition they are associated with. (Each should be associated with at least 1)
- List all Age Groups, and their assigned Competitions, and the resulting # of people in each age group?
 - Connie to help with this design.
 - fix problems when the age groups are not large enough, or when a person's age is >100 (and out of range of the age groups) (problems printing PDFs, etc)
- Make the breadcrumbs sticky.
- see competitors without data and data without competitors before "approving (importing)
- see data by heat (admin-only).

====== Difficult
- Enter start times, with the same start time for many people
- mark comptitor as no-show
- Fix problem when typing in value for "position" and getting it wrong (and it breaks the system)
- Create "Expert T-Shirt" calculation system
- Create "Personalized Schedule" for each competitor
- Change the SCSS include layout so that I can start building common styling elements, like @work.
 - set up scss stylesheets to properly inherit variables/mixins.
 - Fix image path in scss references (compiled vs dev)
- Build a similar TwoAttemptEntry Review/Approve set (like the Single/ImportResult ones)
- enable feature test for two-attempt-entry. (needs JS)
- insteall simple_form_for (for two-attempt-entry form, to help with error reporting?)
- Show the "attempt number" which was faster.
- 100m import action should only allow if it matches the heat data
 - Import action without approval results in all heat entries having data (due to DNS/DNF/DQ)
- Who gets expert T-Shirts?
 - Pick the events that qualify for an expert t-shirt
  - Determine who came in top-3, and then combine all of these people into a list.
  - List the shirt-size for each of these competitors.
  - Allow adding another competition if there are still shirts/etc.

- Would it be possible to sort in HTML and Then export to PDF.
- Move the "PDF" link to be inside the HTML form on all pages, instead of next to the HTML pageview link.
- When publishing results, warn if there is missing data (what constitutes missing data?, but allow Admins to publish the results anyways (though other roles need to fix the data).

==========================================================
Rulebook Comments (after having read through it once)
==========================================================
What is the way in which the High/Long competition will be run?
Connie has ideas about the “most efficient” way of running it. Who is the director, and how do they think it should be run?

Scott: section 4.6 Age Groups (Muni)
There are the age groups that must be used for Muni? (it seems to indicate this by saying "The following age groups are the maximum allowable for muni competitions:”


Section 5.7 Announcing of Results (Freestyle)
This seems to say that we are required to continuously announce the results of the judging. We have always restricted this information until after the awards. Is this still planned to be done?

Scetion 5.23 Individual Freestyle - Technical Score
Should "The Technical part of the judging is broken into four parts” be “three parts”?


5.25.1 Pairs Freestyle: Quantity of Unicycling Skills and Transitions

This section feels like it needs some grammatical correction.





===========================================================
Behaviour comments abotu Data Entry:
===========================================================
When doing data entry, adding data:
Only seeing the first set of data when there is more than 2 data entries for the same person.
The “search” box is being cut off because the footer is overlapping.
Single data entry, can we put the error box near the submit instead of the top.
When an error occurs, put the focus on the first box that is missing.
The error shouldn’t “or rank” because it doesn’t exist here
Don’t allow tab to the competition rulebook.
When there is double-entry it should be highlighted.

======================================================================================================================
======================================================================================================================
======================================================================================================================
======================================================================================================================
======================================================================================================================
======================================================================================================================



========================================================================================================================
TESTING:
- What happens if a competitor has no members? (do the pages display? do the calculations die?)
- Import Data without a Heat/Lane should show a nice error message
 - With a link to the Heat/lane data for lookup

========================================================================================================================
RULEBOOK
- Opensource the Rulebook software
 - address some of the rulebook software issues (See Jan23 E-mail)
