POST-NAUCC 2015 thoughts
=========================
- More Info Link language dependent (put it into th db)
- Copy all Events from other Instance
- Payment THrough PayPal?

Things that caused the most grief:
---------------------------------
- Multi-lap racing data recording was inaccurate enough that it took a lot of manual effort (and time) post-race to get accurate results.
- Double-tab when using chosen-select boxes.
- Import CSV of external Results doesn't work
- Competitors without Members causes the competitors#show page to 500
- Track Day Race Officials were unable to adjust lane assignments for heats (unable to add people to competition)
- "Withdrawn" competitors cause issues for Last-minute-add and other start-line things.
- Having registrants choose a wheel size doesn't translate into an age group (under 10 age)
- Creating Expert Heats of 100m/etc were very manual, and didn't split up by gender.
- Ineligible competitors are not indicated as such on the Announcer Sheet
- Registrant is able to sign up for an event without choosing the "Signup" checkbox.
- External Results had "pts" added next to the name many places
- Time data entry had some issues entering hours:minutes:seconds instead of minutes:seconds:thousands
- Automatically attempting to import data into other competition-within-event was faught against a lot
- Many Reports have "unknown" as the rank place for people who were DNS or DNF.
 - Should be marked as such, and should show up at the END of the list.
- Unclear how to Import Start time data, ...and the review shows nothing because the 'is-start-time' isn't passed to the review page properly.
- pundit use of authorize (user must be logged in) is strange.

Requests:
---------
- Copy Competition

Minor:
------
- Lane Assignment Race Officials needed to use 2 select boxes in order to add last-minute registrants.
- Combined Competition is confusingly still a "Competition"
- The Combined Competition Results are not published for competitors to see.


===================================================
Robin's ToDo List, re-organized August 3, 2015
- Finish the "Preliminary" data concept, as the ExternalResult/TimeResults currently as quite confused with "active" vs "preliminary"
- Improve the error messaging when importing external data and registrants are missing
- Don't display "Wave #" in the sign-in list page unless waves are configured/configurable
- Allow data entry people to enter crank-length/etc data easily.
- Show a page which lists the Locked/Published/Awarded status of each competition.
- Unable to add new race recording data which is a Start Time directly (must go through verification)
- make the rounding of results more predictable (ie: 0.520 vs 0.500 should be rounded the same)
 - This will be taken care of during the competition-data-entry-configuration changes which account for hours/minutes/seconds/hundreds/thousands configuration....I think.
- Make races which have start times required REQUIRE that a start time be entered for each competitor result.
 - If the start time is marked as DQ, or the end time is marked as DQ...then mark the competitor as DQ...unless they have another attempt without DQ..etc.
===================================================

- Gossi/Scott: Implement X-Style scoring system/rules (ask Scott/Gossi for details)
- Patricia Request For group freestyle many times people have alternates planned in case of injury or whatever. These alternates sign up for the group and many times they get added to a group and then they have to be removed and it is up to the person dealing with the data (me) to remember that they are the alternates. There have also been situations when the alternates have emailed me asking me why their names aren't showing up as associated with their group.  If there was a way to add these people to a group and then mark them as alternates that would be cool. Then they could still be listed with the group but would not be counted in the group number total (as used for the fall count). It would then also be possible for the chief judge to easily add them officially to the group in the case that they are needed to actually perform.
- Automatically capitalize any name which is input with all lower, or all upper characters. (must handle i18n though)
- Allow changing the "Name" in My Account without specifying the current password.
- When using Import function, allow a "clear all data" function...to allow restarting the import.
- Po request: Right now on the Manage Competitors page for Group there is no easy way to add people to an already existing group. You have to go to edit and then type in their numbers. This requires memorizing or writing down their numbers. What would be easier would be to check their boxes and then have a new button next to "Create Pair/Group from Selected Registrants" that says "Add to Existing Pair/Group". That button would have a drop down with the already existing group names.
- Create an integrated landing page where people might find the different unicycling events available on the registration system. (ie: naucc.com, or similar)
- Improve the music upload system to be 1 fewer steps by automatically creating the storage record when a user signs up for a music-enabled event?
- Improve the automatic sign-up/un-sign-up syste to be clearer for users
- Add ability to Delete a Competition
- Code the Distance overall calculation.
- integrate with the USA membership site in some way
- Integrate Stripe Payment system.
- create a Checklist for what needs to be asked for each competition:
 - If it is a team/pairs, make sure to ask for a team name/partner name
 - If it has < 24" wheel size categories, be sure to set the "allow wheel size override" option for the event(s) so that users might set their wheel size?
- Be able to publish the combined-competition results more easily.
- When adding a role, don't remove the role if you try to add it to a user who already has that role again. (ie: adding Payment admin to someone with payment admin shouldn't result in them losing it)
- Change DQ in High/Long to DNS
- Import CSV  from External fails poorly when a registrant doesn't exist. It should show a nicer error message.
- The Competition#New form date-choosing field doesn't appear.
- Add report name to the header or footer of all PDFs
- Add page numbers to all PDFs

- Overall Calculations http://naucc2015.unicycling-software.com/en/combined_competitions is sorted randomly
- Display Competitors doesn't work if there are no members in a competitor. (how did that happen?)
- Fix the sort-action causing "no authorization performed" issue.
- Add ability to easily set the number of laps (in bulk) for a competition (like criterium)
- Fix the sortable data table "No results" when adding to the table ajaxy
- Start Line judge (Amanada) should be able to add new lane assignments/adjust them too.
- Can't use "Last minute add" if the registrant is a "withdrawn" competitor (100m)
- Improve the "Expert Heat" display:
 - Needs to "Calculate All Results"
 - Needs to "Display Candidates"
 -
- Use is able to sign up for an event with Event Category but without checking the "Signup" checkbox?
- Street Scoring should honor DNS/Active/etc.

- How are people able to upload music after the music closed date?
- How are they able to upload a wmv file?
- Make logging in a judge easier (easier than having to create a new user, etc etc.)
- Make "Hockey" data entry not automatically add "pts" to the external results preliminaries. (but other events DO do this (like trials))

- Create a role which is able to perform the race data heat/lane actions
- Don't have the import routine automatically move to the next heat after import
- Have an easy way to consolidate judge results and imported results into real results.
- Why is the LIF importing hundreds instead of thousands?
- Test the LIF import from new data files from the timer
- Move logic out of the ImportResultsController into another controller
- Include Judge Notes in resulting time-Results record
- Allow Publishing of Age Group data easily
- MINOR: Allow DNS

- Rename "Can create competitors at lane assignment" to something more clear to its use.
- Data Entry person should be able to DNS a competitor.
- How to enter wheelsize/crank length on Time Trial (one-data-per-line event)
- Add a report which allows comparing whether a registrant has results in 2 different disciplines (like Advanced + Beginner Trials)
- Director of event should be able to "Set Places"
- make Preliminary external results AJAX
- trials should have a sign-in list.
- Double check to see whether UNICON2014 Street will work properly because the higher-poinst are better?

res = {}
Registrant.all.each do |registrant|
  comps = registrant.competitions.pluck(:id).sort
  res[registrant.bib_number] = comps - comps.uniq
end

res = {}
Registrant.all.each do |registrant|
  comps = registrant.competitors.pluck(:competition_id).sort
  res[registrant.bib_number] = comps - comps.uniq
end
NEITHER SHOW ANY RESULTS

- Mark all "dropped" (but not signed-up-again) as "Withdraw"
to_drop = []
Competitor.all.each do |comp|
  if comp.members.size == 1
    member = comp.members.first
    if member.dropped_from_registration? && comp.active?
      # to_drop << "I just withdrew #{comp} from #{comp.competition}"
      comp.update_attributes(status: "withdrawn")
    end
  end
end
to_drop

- Deleting a registrant should "Withdraw" them from all competitions that they are competitors for.
- TwoAttemptEntry and Import Result pages should show the competitors who have results on the page, so that importers don't get confused once they have "Approved" the results during Review.
- Data Entry Volunteers should be tested, to ensure that they can enter/approve the data necessary
- Director should be tested to ensure he can see the data ,and lock the competition, and publish? the competition
END

- Make imports only Director-level possible
- Wave time entry is direcor only
- Volunteer can enter Sign In lists

- Allow chosen to work on mobile devices
- fix small screen view of competition#show
- Fix chosen on mobile devices? look at http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/

- If reg is signed up for an event currently, they should not show the "Dropped" text
- Withdrawn but not dropped, you should be pink, with additional text

- Registration ManageOne doesn't work on Firefox.WTF robin

Dropped is "did I ever drop, and I'm not currently signed up".

- on the Sign In list, there should not be any Withdrawn people, and the option for Withdrawn should not appear.
- On the Data Entry page for 10k, anyone who is not "Active" competitor should not appear in the list.
-
- Make the Competitors#Index page not "Delete" but "withdraw", and make this ajax
- If the competitor is withdrawn and dropped, the text need not be red.
- Make the Street results preview page sortable on the final results table.
- If I withdrew, what do I do on the paper?

- Add indication next to "important dates" part of whether the date has passed (perhps have a countdown of the time remaining)
- Caching is not clearing on the registrant#summary page if the competitor's status is updated.

- Overall champion result should be 'pts', and should be rounded?

- Move the "show confirmed events" feature into competition-admin-space?

TODO: Download the db to Scott+Robin's laptops
TODO: Spin up and suspend a backup server (including new redis)
TODO: check caching using the new pundit service.
TODO: Check caching in general.

To Gain confidence in any e-mail sent out, I would like to have an e-mail sent to the currently-logged-in-user with the number of e-mail addresses, and the contents of the email.

======================================================
- Remove ":admin" ability from database?
- Inspect performance of making the (many) .has_role? calls for a user.
- Use "Scope" in Pundit as it is expected to be used?
- Test the access control settings from various users
- Check coverage, and add controller specs for those that are missing.
- Add specs for policies, based on the old ability_specs.
- As a Judge (or data entry volunteer?), why can I iew the Competition#show page?
 -  I think that we should have separate views for the awards admin to view the status of competitions
 - I think that data entry volunteers should NOT have access
- Put a "missing music upload" warning together on the registrants#index page
- Put a "missing pairs partner name" on the registrants#index pages

- Add the ability for a user to change their "short name" for their account (same name as is changed by "Data Entry Volunteer")

================== New Awards/Results Calculation Logic ============================
- Combine the AwardLabel multiple-lines-of-text with the Registrant#results page, with the Result object data
- Why are we always listing "Overall" as well as "Age Group" for each competition type?
 - When we do "Award Labels", it doesn't result in both of these...so we shouldn't do it in the results page.

 - Need to determine if a competition should result in:
  - 1) Age Group Only (ie: If "Expert", they will actually be age-group only?)
  - 2) overall AND age group
  - 3) age group

- Need to determine if a competition should result in awards for (a combination of):
 - 1) overall (without Expert naming)
 - 2) overall (WITH expert naming)
 - 3) age_group (with age-group-specific subtitle)
 - 4) age_group (with Competiiton->award_subtitle-Name)

- Inputs:
 - Competition.has_experts?
 - Competition.has_age_group_entry_resuls? (aka age_group_type.present?)

- There are times when we need to determine overall, but we don't award it. (like 100m, where the overall is used to determine the experts candidates)


- LATE Registrant is unable to create a new Competitor registrant (there is no current registration period?)

- Need to ONLY show results which are for "Awarded" Competitions
======================================================================================

- Add tests around the new library refactorings
- How does a Director manage/adjust the high/long scores after a judge has judged?

Want to do:
- spec which uses import_results_Controller->display_csv -> import_csv to create external results
 - then uses Approve action to convert the results to real results.
- Determine if the servers have any ImportResults left on them.

- Remove default_scope on ImportResult

NEED to clear up the "target_competition" logic of the import! function (used for the mulitple-10k competition-in-same-dataset problem)

WHEN DOING an Import from CSV, fail the whole import, listing the entries which cannot be handled yet clearly, allowing them to be resolved (perhaps a "add these people as competitors" choice?)

? ask scott/patricia? - Boundary-score calculation judge for freestyle? (major/minor falls counter)
 - For UNIOEC?
- Must update the Ineligibility of all registrants before starting competition.

PRiorities as per Scott/Robin Discussion:

 +source 'https://rails-assets.org' do
> +  gem 'rails-assets-datetimepicker'
> +end

- If a competition is created with "automatic competitor creation", it should prompt "Should I add all currently configured competitors?" immediately after creating the competition.
- Handle Ineligible results when calculating placing points?
- Flatland/etc calculation with "ineligible", does it properly give placing points?
- Combine the scoring data entry paths, with different partials as necessary?
  - Is this even possible, considering different interaction-requirements?
  - Is this a good idea?
- Make External Result data entry system smarter, so that it doesn't prompt me to enter scores for a competitor which already has scores. (use chosen's greyed-out-select?)
- Are the order of age groups important for anything other than Track? Can we clean that up?

- Disable start/finish data-entry if you choose certain scoring types (like Street, High/Long, freestyle, Flat?)

- After refunding, if the registration can be deleted, prompt the admin whether they want to delete that user.


- Allow creating Expert events without specifynig an age group? (ie: 100m expert shouldn't need an age group)


- Describe the Scoring classes better:
 - Externally Ranked - Provide an Export/Import routine for entering the results
 - One-Result - Each

  - Expert placing
  - Age group name
  - Age group placing

Possibly store all published results 2x. Once with a TOD, once without any random characters (just "Trials_results.pdf"). This way, any sharing of the link will be to the same-named file at all times
 - Additionally, we are able to keep around all previously published results, for reference by admins, if desired/needed.

what is uni-alpha? (same as 'unicycling', but with less (no) data)
what is unicycling? (naucc2012 Standard Skill routine entry menu)

- Slopestyle Street:
5 judges, each judge scores the competitor by:
 - Variety (/10)
 - Consistency (/10)
 - Difficulty (/10)
A super-judge by Time:
 - Time (/5, fastest=5, slowest=0)

- In the 50m WW, why doesn't a 20" able to compete? Is it the size of the cranks.

- Wheel Walk results show doesn't Experts vs not, in order to be able to differenciate.
  - Also decide whether Experts should be 1 or 2 (m/f) competitions.
- better way to do in-place sorting than the current age-group-type sorting.

- Connie/Scott: Rulebook question: can a 0-10 20” racing-categroy competitor win the expert slow… If so, then any competitor (no matter what wheel) can win. Expert will be non-wheel-size.
 - Answer: no. it cannot.
 -  "** Calculation of the Experts cannot use results which are in the 20"or 16" category."
  - ANSWER: to solve this, only peopleo on 24" wheels will have an "overall_place" for 100m.
 - IS THIS CLEAR AND CODIFIED?


- Should we change the way that the data recording forms are written for NAUCC?
 - On the Competitors List:
  - Split it by ID only, then record their 2 times
  - See the gender of the competition, or split the competitors by gender.

===========================================================
Behaviour comments abotu Data Entry:
===========================================================
When doing data entry, adding data:
Only seeing the first set of data when there is more than 2 data entries for the same person.
The “search” box is being cut off because the footer is overlapping.
Single data entry, can we put the error box near the submit instead of the top.
When an error occurs, put the focus on the first box that is missing.
The error shouldn’t “or rank” because it doesn’t exist here
Don’t allow tab to the competition rulebook.
When there is double-entry it should be highlighted.

========================================================================================================================
Rulebook Rule changes desired:

- Add a rulebook rule for how to cut off the ends of High/Long competition (you are allowed to jump...forever?)
- add recommendations for how to schedule an event, including awarding younger riders' awards earlier, and not performing awards the same evening as an event.
- add recommendation for scheduling event to include always having water stations, clearly labeled bathrooms, and announcing medical services are available, where.

- Scott/Hugo/benoit - UNICON rule: Scott, can we add a rule to Trials for tie-breakers, so that we know that people need to be present for tie-breaking.


What is the way in which the High/Long competition will be run?
Connie has ideas about the “most efficient” way of running it. Who is the director, and how do they think it should be run?

Scott: section 4.6 Age Groups (Muni)
There are the age groups that must be used for Muni? (it seems to indicate this by saying "The following age groups are the maximum allowable for muni competitions:”


Section 5.7 Announcing of Results (Freestyle)
This seems to say that we are required to continuously announce the results of the judging. We have always restricted this information until after the awards. Is this still planned to be done?

Scetion 5.23 Individual Freestyle - Technical Score
Should "The Technical part of the judging is broken into four parts” be “three parts”?


5.25.1 Pairs Freestyle: Quantity of Unicycling Skills and Transitions

This section feels like it needs some grammatical correction.
