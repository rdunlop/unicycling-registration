    I acknowledge that by signing this document, I am assuming risks, and agreeing to
    indemnify, not to sue, and release from liability the organizer of this event and
    their respective agents, employees, volunteers, members, clubs, sponsors, promoters,
    and affiliates (collectively "Releasees"), and that I am giving up substantial legal
    rights.  This release is a contract with legal and binding consequences and it
    applies to all races and activities entered at the event, regardless whether or not
    listed above.  I have read it carefully before signing, and I understand what it
    means and what I am agreeing to by signing.


    In consideration of the issuance of a license to me by one or more Releasees or the
    acceptance of my application for entry in the above event, I hereby freely agree to
    and make the following contractual representations and agreements.  I ACKNOWLEDGE
    THAT CYCLING IS AN INHERENTLY DANGEROUS SPORT AND FULLY REALIZE THE DANGERS OF
    PARTICIPATING IN THIS EVENT, whether as a rider, official, coach, mechanic,
    volunteer, or otherwise, and FULLY ASSUME THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH
    PARTICIPATION  INCLUDING, by way of example, and not limitation: dangers associated
    with manmade and natural jumps; the dangers of collision with pedestrians, vehicles,
    other riders, and fixed or moving objects; the dangers arising from surface hazards,
    including pot holes, equipment failure, inadequate safety equipment, use of equipment
    or materials provided by the event organizer and others, THE RELEASEES' OWN
    NEGLIGENCE, the negligence of others and weather conditions; and the possibility of
    serious physical and/or mental trauma or injury, or death associated with the event.
    For myself, my heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, assignees,
    and successors in interest (collectively "Successors") I HEREBY WAIVE, RELEASE,
    DISCHARGE, HOLD HARMLESS, AND PROMISE TO INDEMNIFY AND NOT TO SUE the Releasees and
    all sponsors, organizers and promoting organizations, property owners, law
    enforcement agencies, public entities, special districts and properties that are in
    any manner connected with this event, and their respective agents, officials, and
    employees through or by which the event will be held, (the foregoing are also
    collectively deemed to be Releasees), FROM ANY AND ALL RIGHTS AND CLAIMS INCLUDING
    CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE RELEASEES' OWN NEGLIGENCE TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    LAW, which I have or which may hereafter accrue to me and from any and all damages
    which may be sustained by me directly or indirectly in connection with, or arising
    out of, my participation in or association with the event, or travel to or return
    from the event.


    I agree it is my sole responsibility to be familiar with the event course and agenda,
    the Releasees' rules, and any special regulation for the event and agree to comply
    with all such rules and regulations.  I understand and agree that situations may
    arise during the event which may be beyond the control of the Releasees, and I must
    continually ride and otherwise participate so as to neither endanger myself nor
    others.  I accept responsibility for the condition and adequacy of my equipment and
    any equipment provide for my use, and my conduct in connection with this event.  I
    will wear a helmet and protective gear which satisfies the requirements of the
    Releasees' Racing Rules and Regulations and that can protect against serious head
    injury, and assume all responsibility and liability for the selection of such a
    helmet.


    I have no physical or medical condition which would endanger myself or others if I
    participate in this event, or would interfere with my ability to safely participate
    in this event.


    I agree, for myself and my Successors, that the above representations are
    contractually binding, and are not mere recitals, and that should I or my Successors
    assert a claim contrary to what I have agreed to in this contract, the claiming party
    shall be liable for the expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Releasees in
    defending the claims.  This contract may not be modified orally, and a waiver or
    modification of any provision shall not be construed as a waiver or modification of
    any other provision heron or as consent to any subsequent waiver or modification.


    I consent to release by any third party to Releasees and their insurance carriers of
    my name and medical information that may relate solely to any injury or death I may
    suffer arising from the event.  Every term and provision of this contract is intended
    to be severable.  If any one or more of them is found to be unenforceable or invalid,
    that shall not affect the other terms and provisions, which shall remain binding and
    enforceable.
