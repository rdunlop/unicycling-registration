Unicycling Software - Overall Design Document
=============================================

Purpose:

 * Describe the interfaces and responsibilities of each system in the Unicycling software ecosystem.
 * Reference each of the software pieces, so that you can choose which one(s) you need for your event.


EventClass
==========

An EventClass has the following effects:
- Competition: how do "places" get calculated?
- Competition: what is the printed description of the results ("Time", "Score", etc)
- AWardLabel: do we print the name of the competition along with the Event name, or just the competition name ***** do some other way?
- Competitor: does a competitor have any results, based on the way that the competition is being calculated
- Compteitor: what is the current score/result for the competitor 
- JudgeType: Display this judge-type as an option when
- CompetitionController: what are all of the results for a competiton (be able to destroy them all)
- CompetitonController: when setting all places, where do I redirect to (XXX can be eliminated with helpers?)
- CompetiionController: export_function chooses the results (should be combined with the competitor.result probably)
- EventsController: chooses which events to show on each of the pages o
- ImportController: determine the type of data being importetd for a competition (Time, or External)
- ImportController :determine how to convert from an ImportResult into a true result (Time, or External)

- EventsHelper: Where are scores entered
- EventsHelper: Where are scores summarized
- EventsHelper: some others (not needed?)


Registration (Ruby on Rails)
============

The Registration system is an online application which is designed to be hosted months before the competition.
It allows the event organizers to configure the offered events, and set the prices for competitor/non-competitor registrations.
It is easily able to be configured to work with paypal for online payment processing.

Inputs:

* Requires configuration of the details of the unicycling competition
 * Which races/competitions
 * Date of competition

Outputs:

* Set of unique registration records, each of which is associated with multiple events, and multiple details for those events.

UCP (Access database)
===

The Unicycling Convention Program (UCP) is a pair of Microsoft Access databases. It is able to:
 * Perform registration-handling functions (data input)
 * Perform Age Group configuration (for event organizers to know how many people in each event/category)
  * Note: Age group calculation are not well defined
 * Perform Judging score input, calculation and reporting
 * Perform reporting of both event-sign-up
 * Perform reporting of event-results

Inputs:

* Can be configured using the output of the Registration system, or can be configured independently
* Can import (soon) data from the Registration system


Judging (Ruby on Rails)
=======

The Judging application is to be used by judges during the competitins themselves.
It is designed to be used by the judges for data entry/transcription.

Inputs:

* Requires configuration of the events, as well as the list of judges who can judge the event.
 * This is an output from UCP

Outputs:

1) A report of raw scores, which can be imported into UCP

2) [soon] A report of the resulting scores, places, which can be used for other reporting purposes?


-------------------------
Data Flow analysis/ideas:


1) Registration Details:
 - Name/Contact
  - Event sign up choices

Used for configuring/populating UCP

2) Event Configuration Details:
 - Event names
  - Event choices

Used for configuring UCP?
 

3) Event-Competitor Details:
 - Name/ID - Event configuration

Used for configuring the Judging Application


4) Judging Results:
 - Competitor, Judge, Scores

Used for transferring data back into UCP for the "official" calculations.



------
ROLES:
------

SuperAdmin: (e.g.: Robin)
 - Configures the system, is given the power to destroy everything, and shoot themselves in the foot often.

Admin: (e.g. Connie)
 - Able to do many things that normal users cannot
 - Able to view/modify Payment/Registration data

Judge:
 - Able to view/use the judge-data entry system
 - Able to judge any event, in any way (judges are not event-specific)
 - Able to ONLY view their own scores

Chief Judge (for an event):
 - Able to do assign judges
 - Able to do everything a judge can do (when they self-assign themselves as a judge)
 - Able to see the results that judges have entered
 - Able to "Lock" event_categories once scoring is completed




=============================
How would I like it to work?


Registration gathering:
- Event organizers configure the events being offered, adding/removing as desired.
- Event organizers define the prices and price-increase schedule
- Registration opens, and payment is received.

Event Configuration:
- Event organizers can use the initial event-configuration to seed this system, which then presents them with the options/configuration-dials necessary to fully define each event/age-groups.
- This system can run independently of the Registration site, and does not require any "payment" system integration (allows import of excel file for registrant details)
- Outputs a list of Event/competitor lists, which can be used to determine who is competing when/where.

Judging data application:
- Is designed to be used by trusted/trained personnel for inputting race data.
- Each race may initially be configured with a list of "competitors in this event"
- Each race may initially be configured with the judging rules, which determines the "type" of the race, such as Slow race, multi-lap, group, etc.
- Data-verification steps are built in, which allow easy manual-checking of data entry.
- Outputs a list of raw data entered

- This system can also import data from itself, which allows the system to be used in a distributed manner, and re-synchronized easily.
 - The data file will contain everything that has been entered, which allows re-creation of the same results on any other instance of the system.

Awards printing and results printing/displaying:
- Outputs a list of results of competition, which can be posted, and shows who-won, etc.
- Maintains a list of "released reports", for ease of publishing results/etc.
- Data can be entered via import of electronic-data files, or manually.

QUESITON:
- Which system deals with calculating the overall winners? (probably the judging data application?)

------
Things that UCP does that are not handled by the above design:

- Generate reports of Overall chamipions
- Generate repotrs for "Expert T-Shirts"
- Standard Skill Data entry/judging/reporting
- Medals formatting and report printing
- Basketball data entry/processing (UCP doesn't really do this either)
- Report of the results for a competitor (summary format)
- Printing Start-lists (well, maybe by the new judging system?)
- Allow easy addition of new registrants (multiple systems need multiple-updates)
-
