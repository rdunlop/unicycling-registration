%h1 Lodgings

%p Using this system, you can sell a limited number of lodging rooms/options.

%p This is different than the "Items for Sale" system because it allows a user to specify the days that they want to book the lodging, and creates a single LodgingPackage for them to pay for. It also manages the limited number of lodging rooms available at each Lodging location.
