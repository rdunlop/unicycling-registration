    I acknowledge that by signing this document, I am assuming risks, and agreeing to 
    indemnify, not to sue, and release from liability the organizer of this event and 
    their respective agents, employees, volunteers, members, clubs, sponsors, promoters, 
    and affiliates (collectively "Releasees"), and that I am giving up substantial legal 
    rights.  This release is a contract with legal and binding consequences and it 
    applies to all races and activities entered at the event, regardless whether or not 
    listed above.  I have read it carefully before signing, and I understand what it 
    means and what I am agreeing to by signing.

    <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin: 0">
    In consideration of the issuance of a license to me by one or more Releasees or the 
    acceptance of my application for entry in the above event, I hereby freely agree to 
    and make the following contractual representations and agreements.  I ACKNOWLEDGE 
    THAT CYCLING IS AN INHERENTLY DANGEROUS SPORT AND FULLY REALIZE THE DANGERS OF 
    PARTICIPATING IN THIS EVENT, whether as a rider, official, coach, mechanic, 
    volunteer, or otherwise, and FULLY ASSUME THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH 
    PARTICIPATION  INCLUDING, by way of example, and not limitation: dangers associated 
    with manmade and natural jumps; the dangers of collision with pedestrians, vehicles, 
    other riders, and fixed or moving objects; the dangers arising from surface hazards, 
    including pot holes, equipment failure, inadequate safety equipment, use of equipment 
    or materials provided by the event organizer and others, THE RELEASEES' OWN 
    NEGLIGENCE, the negligence of others and weather conditions; and the possibility of 
    serious physical and/or mental trauma or injury, or death associated with the event.  
    For myself, my heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, assignees, 
    and successors in interest (collectively "Successors") I HEREBY WAIVE, RELEASE, 
    DISCHARGE, HOLD HARMLESS, AND PROMISE TO INDEMNIFY AND NOT TO SUE the Releasees and 
    all sponsors, organizers and promoting organizations, property owners, law 
    enforcement agencies, public entities, special districts and properties that are in 
    any manner connected with this event, and their respective agents, officials, and 
    employees through or by which the event will be held, (the foregoing are also 
    collectively deemed to be Releasees), FROM ANY AND ALL RIGHTS AND CLAIMS INCLUDING 
    CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE RELEASEES' OWN NEGLIGENCE TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
    LAW, which I have or which may hereafter accrue to me and from any and all damages 
    which may be sustained by me directly or indirectly in connection with, or arising 
    out of, my participation in or association with the event, or travel to or return 
    from the event.

    I agree it is my sole responsibility to be familiar with the event course and agenda, 
    the Releasees' rules, and any special regulation for the event and agree to comply 
    with all such rules and regulations.  I understand and agree that situations may 
    arise during the event which may be beyond the control of the Releasees, and I must 
    continually ride and otherwise participate so as to neither endanger myself nor 
    others.  I accept responsibility for the condition and adequacy of my equipment and 
    any equipment provide for my use, and my conduct in connection with this event.  I 
    will wear a helmet and protective gear which satisfies the requirements of the 
    Releasees' Racing Rules and Regulations and that can protect against serious head 
    injury, and assume all responsibility and liability for the selection of such a 
    helmet.

    I agree, for myself and my Successors, that the above representations are

    shall be liable for the expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Releasees in 
    defending the claims.  This contract may not be modified orally, and a waiver or 
    modification of any provision shall not be construed as a waiver or modification of 
    any other provision heron or as consent to any subsequent waiver or modification.

    to be severable.  If any one or more of them is found to be unenforceable or invalid,
