/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * DO NOT add application-wide styles to this file. Rather add application-wide styles
 * to the common/common.css file.
 *
 * You can add event-specific styles that override these common styles. For each event, you can
 * create a file with the name |EventConfiguration.short_name.downcase.tr(" ", "_")}|.scss.
 * (That is the event short name, all lowercase, with underscores for spaces.)
 * For example naucc_2013.scss or unicon_17.scss.
