  # 5.10.1 Removing The High And Low
  # After determining placing points as above, discard the highest and lowest placing score
  # for each rider. If Rider A has scores of 1,2,1,3,2, take out one of the ones, and the three.
  # Then Rider A has 1,2,2, for a total of 5. If Rider B has scores of 2,2,2,2,2, he will end
  # up with 2,2,2, a total of 6. The winner is the competitor with the lowest total placing
  # points score after the high and low have been removed.
  #
  # 5.10.2 Ties
  # If more than one competitor has the same placing score after the above process, those
  # riders will be ranked based on their placing scores for Technical. The scoring process
  # must be repeated using only the Technical scores for the tied riders to determine this
  # rank. High and low placing scores are again removed in the process. If competitors'
  # Technical ranking comes out equal, all competitors with the same score are awarded the
  # same place.
